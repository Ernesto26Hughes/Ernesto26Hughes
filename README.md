## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a full-stack developer focused on building secure, high-performance web applications using Angular, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. This space showcases my ongoing work, experiments, and projects that reflect my approach to full-stack developmentâ€”with a strong emphasis on clean code, security best practices, and end-to-end functionality.

On the front-end, I use Angular to build responsive and interactive user interfaces. Angularâ€™s powerful features like reactive forms, component-based architecture, and built-in routing make it my go-to framework for creating scalable and maintainable UIs. I enjoy crafting interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also optimized for performance and accessibility.

On the server side, I rely on Node.js and Express to develop RESTful APIs that are efficient, modular, and secure. I follow best practices for middleware design, input validation, authentication (including JWT), and error handling to ensure that the backend is both reliable and easy to work with. Security is a top priority in all of my projectsâ€”whether itâ€™s protecting routes, hashing passwords, or mitigating common web vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection.

PostgreSQL serves as the foundation for most of my data storage needs. I use it to design robust relational schemas, implement complex queries, and manage data integrity. Iâ€™m also experienced in handling migrations, indexing strategies, and optimizing query performance for large-scale applications.

This repository includes full-stack applications, API examples, and reusable components that demonstrate real-world use cases. Each project reflects my commitment to building secure and well-structured systems that are easy to maintain and scale.

Feel free to explore the projects, open an issue, or contribute. Iâ€™m always open to collaboration and discussion around full-stack development and secure software design.
